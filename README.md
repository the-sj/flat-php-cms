flat-php-cms
============

PHP CMS (in development), uses bootstrap on frontend.
Will rewrite in objects (OOP). Now i got to make coffee and start working on it.

Also, you need to create file db_connect.php in components/, with contents:
define(DB_USERNAME, 'username');
define(DB_PASSWORD, 'password');
define(DB_DATABASE, 'database');
define(DB_SERVER, 'localhost');

Oh, lol, i've forgot to make database dump, lol.
